### 1. Overview
The **Dynamic Background Hypothesis (DBH)** is a unified field theory that models the physical vacuum as a **relativistic nematic superfluid substrate**. Unlike standard models that treat spacetime as a passive stage, the DBH derives geometry, matter, and all fundamental interactions as collective excitations of this active medium.

The **v5.0 Beta** release marks a milestone in the program by deriving the **Mass Hierarchy** and the **Structural Constants** of nature ($1/\phi$, $137$, $1836$) from first-principles vacuum rheology, establishing the DBH as a predictive **Theory of Everything (TOE)**.

### 2. Key Breakthroughs (v5.0 Beta Update)
*   **Mass Hierarchy & Attractors:** Discovery of discrete stability regimes. The **Electron** emerges as the natural unit of mass ($M_e \approx 1/\phi$), while the **Hadronic Scale** ($\approx 10^3$) is derived from dimensional evasion.
*   **Structural Constants:** Derivation of the **137 ratio** (Fine Structure Constant) as the gauge-dressed invariant of vacuum stiffness and the **1836 ratio** (Proton/Electron) as the limit of structural confinement.
*   **Unified Action v4:** Analytical derivation of the MOND scale ($a_0$) and Color Confinement from a single non-polynomial potential.
*   **Emergent Electroweak Sector:** Proof of Maxwell’s equations and $SU(2)$ weak symmetry from spinor holonomy and defect braiding.
*   **Strong Force & Confinement:** Hydrodynamic visualization of **Flux Tubes (Gluons)** and the rheological "freezing" of the vacuum between quarks.
*   **Homeostatic Cosmology:** Validation of a stable cosmic attractor that ensures an eternal, self-recycling universe.
