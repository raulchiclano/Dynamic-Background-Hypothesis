### 1. Overview
The **Dynamic Background Hypothesis (DBH)** is a unified field theory that models the physical vacuum as a **relativistic nematic superfluid substrate**. Unlike standard models that treat spacetime as a passive stage, the DBH derives geometry, matter, and all fundamental interactions as collective excitations of this active medium.

The **v5.0 Alpha** release completes the grand unification program by deriving the **Strong and Weak nuclear forces** from the topological braiding and elastic phase transitions of the vacuum, establishing the DBH as a mathematically consistent **Theory of Everything (TOE)**.

### 2. Key Breakthroughs (v5.0 Alpha Update)
*   **Unified Action v4:** Analytical derivation of the MOND scale ($a_0$) from vacuum rheology.
*   **Emergent Electromagnetism:** Proof of Maxwell’s equations as the topological vorticity of the vacuum flow.
*   **Weak Force Emergence ($SU(2)$):** Derivation of non-abelian gauge symmetry from the **spinor holonomy** and braiding of $Q=1/2$ nematic defects.
*   **Strong Force & Confinment ($SU(3)$):** First hydrodynamic visualization of **Flux Tubes (Gluons)**. We demonstrate that the $\sigma \rho^{3/2}$ term in the Action v4 triggers a local phase transition that confines quarks.
*   **Lorentz Invariance as Equilibrium:** Derivation of the Minkowski metric as the minimum energy state of the substrate.
*   **Homeostatic Cosmology:** Discovery of a stable attractor in the matter-background phase space, ensuring an eternal, self-recycling universe.
